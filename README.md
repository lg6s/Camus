# Camus

A markup language.

## Why another markup language

The reason is simple. I need a language for writing blogs but I got tired of using markdown, so I decided to make my own.

## What does it look like

There's a file named ```test.cm2``` in the repo; that's some kind of "sketch" of how do I want it to be like. It also serves as a test file during the development of Camus.

There's also an older version of Camus in the branch ```legacy```.
